# Tethered Onslaught
+ 2D (might be developed to 3D later)
+ A duo of players are physically linked by an electric tether in a chaotic battle arena. They have to fight endless waves of enemies for survival using the tether.
  + The tether allows ability sharing, such as when a player blinks, the other player also blinks in sync.
  + The tether create a shield when 2 players move in unison next to each other.
  + If players are far from each other a certain range, they can use the tether to electrocute the enemies.
  + Players must coordinate to maximize combo bonuses by chaining kills, combos can be used if 2 players do a set of action at the same time.
+ Tether is customizable with mystery boxes (e.g., turning it into a laser whip or a stun trap).
+ There's a leaderboard for longest survival time and highest combo chains.
+ The game can be in multiple settings bases on the rounds, it can be frost/retro/etc.
